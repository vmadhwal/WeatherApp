# The Weather Forecasting

The Weather Forecasting app allows users to search for locations by city name and observe the weather for the next 5-6 days with a 3-hour interval. The app is developed using React.js and material-UI.
The Toggle Button lets the user toggle between the temperature from Celius to Fahrenheit.
